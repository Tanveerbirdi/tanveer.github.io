<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">A renowned name in the manufacturing of Cycles in North India,
<p style="line-height:30px;"> City Cycles is a product of this philosophy. The philosophy that instills commitment, team work and foresight. City’s colossal journey started before independence. The four Munjal brothers, hailing from a small town called Kamalia, now in Pakistan, are the men who are behind the mission. Brotherhood apart, what knit the men together was the wealth of will, integrity, ambition & determination. In the year 1944, they decided to start a business of bicycle spare parts in Amritsar.But the dark clouds of partition eclipsed their plans of the future. With renewed vigour and optimism, the operational base was shifted to Ludhiana. By 1956, the brothers had began manufacturing key components of bicycles and as a logical way forward, began to assemble the entire cycle at their manufacturing plant in Ludhiana. In the early days, the plant had a capacity for 25 cycles per day. Over the next few years, the Bicycle Unit started growing in stature and size, attracting skilled engineers, technocrats, administrators and entrepreneurs. From a modest beginning of mere 639 bicycles in the year 1956, City Cycles products over 18500 cycles a day today, the highest in global reckoning.<br />A tiny acorn has now become a mighty Oak. From cycle to two - wheelers was a natural step, and the Hero Group came into being. The Hero Group, today, is a vast conglomerate of companies, either in the form of collaborations, joint ventures or fully owned subsidiaries, with more than Rs. 10000 Crore turnover annually. Hero Group, besides being the world’s largest manufacturers of bicycles, motorcycles and chains to this date, has diversified into newer segments like Information Technology, IT Enabled Services and Financial Services</p></font>
